Whether you are using **John Snow Labs, Hugging Face, Spacy** models or **OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Hugging Face Inference API and Azure-OpenAI** based LLMs, it has got you covered. You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification, fill-mask, Translation model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering, Summarization and text-generation tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 60+ out of the box tests. For a complete list of supported test categories, please refer to the [documentation](http://langtest.org/docs/pages/docs/test_categories).\n",
