    "**LangTest** is an open-source python library designed to help developers deliver safe and effective Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Whether you are using **John Snow Labs, Hugging Face, Spacy** models or **OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Hugging Face Inference API and Azure-OpenAI** based LLMs, it has got you covered. You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification, fill-mask, Translation model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering, Summarization and text-generation tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 60+ out of the box tests. For a complete list of supported test categories, please refer to the [documentation](http://langtest.org/docs/pages/docs/test_categories)."

    "\n",
    "Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior in which models tailor their responses to align with a human user's view, even when that view is not objectively correct. In this notebook, we propose a simple synthetic data intervention to reduce this behavior in language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sycophantic behavior in models can lead to biased and unreliable responses. To address this issue, we employ a two-fold synthetic data intervention approach. This involves generating examples in which simulated users express their opinions, and we manipulate the options (e.g., changing 'A' to disagree and 'B' to agree) to observe how the model responds.\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "If the user wants to consider the ground truth (which can be specified through the config), we perform the evaluation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the model's responses using three columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ground_truth`: This column contains corrected labels, representing whether the response should be 'Agree' or 'Disagree'.\n",

    "- `actual_result`: This column contains results with the human math prompt and potential option manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform a parallel comparison of the ground truth with the expected_result and the ground truth with the actual_result to determine whether the model's response passes the evaluation.\n",
