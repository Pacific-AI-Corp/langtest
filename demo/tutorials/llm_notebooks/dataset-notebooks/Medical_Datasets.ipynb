Whether you are using **John Snow Labs, Hugging Face, Spacy** models or **OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Hugging Face Inference API and Azure-OpenAI** based LLMs, it has got you covered. You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification, fill-mask, Translation model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering, Summarization and text-generation tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 60+ out of the box tests. For a complete list of supported test categories, please refer to the [documentation](http://langtest.org/docs/pages/docs/test_categories).\n",

              "1   Valium (diazepam) is a benzodiazepine that affects the brain by enhancing the activity of neurotransmitters such as GABA, leading to sedation, relaxation, and reduced anxiety. It binds to GABA receptors, increasing chloride ion flow into neurons, resulting in a calming effect on the nervous system. This action can also lead to drowsiness, impaired cognitive function, and muscle relaxation.   \n",
