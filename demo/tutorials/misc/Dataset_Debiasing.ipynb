    "**LangTest** is an open-source python library designed to help developers deliver safe and effective Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Whether you are using **John Snow Labs, Hugging Face, Spacy** models or **OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Hugging Face Inference API and Azure-OpenAI** based LLMs, it has got you covered. You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification, fill-mask, Translation model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering, Summarization and text-generation tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 60+ out of the box tests. For a complete list of supported test categories, please refer to the [documentation](http://langtest.org/docs/pages/docs/test_categories).\n",

They are 24 years old, originally from Fife, and started playing the bagpipes when they were only six years old. Now, they are part of a bagpipe pop group called the Rollin' Drones and have played at gigs across the world, helped to break down musical stereotypes in the industry and gained popularity on TikTok for their Scottish twists on modern pop songs. \"It's my little fun fact, people are often surprised that I would play the bagpipes, but I love it,\" they said. And they have big ambitions for the future â€“ including a dream to perform at the 14,300 capacity OVO Hydro in Glasgow and to work with a major music artist.  \n",
       "3   CCTV images capture the moment an individual involved in theft was apprehended during a police operation in south London. A 36-year-old male was in the Co-op food shop in Lower Marsh near Waterloo Station on Monday, 27 January, where he started emptying the contents of a meat chiller into a bag. He didn't realize police officers were waiting in the back of the shop, ready to intervene, after the store had reported several thefts. The individual was caught in the act by officers who swooped in and took him down, arresting him at the scene. He appeared at Croydon Magistrates' Court the following day, where he was jailed for eight weeks after admitting to two counts of theft. A police spokesperson stated: \"This is an excellent example of how the Met is taking a targeted approach to tackle the type of offending that matters most to Londoners.\" Follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.
