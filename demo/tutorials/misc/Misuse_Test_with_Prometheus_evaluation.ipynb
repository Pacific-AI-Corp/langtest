Whether you are using **John Snow Labs, Hugging Face, Spacy** models or **OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Hugging Face Inference API and Azure-OpenAI** based LLMs, it has got you covered. You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering and Summarization tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 50+ out of the box tests. These tests fall into robustness, accuracy, bias, representation, toxicity and fairness test categories."
